This skill lets you set the verbosity/log level on the mycroft cli

## About
As a mycroft developer i want this skill to let me turn verbosity up on the command line interface so that i can better understand what’s going on inside of mycroft.

eg. for example, i would say “hey mycroft, in the cli, set verbosity to (normal|high|very high).” if i said “high” then verbosity would go up, and i would see json intent packets printed for all forthcoming commands. i’d be much better able to debug failed command

## Examples
* "Set verbosity to low/normal/high"
* "Set log level to critical/error/warning/info/debug"
